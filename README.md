# ObstacleDetection

We are seeking to evaluate the capabilities of the PGA450Q1EVM-S by Texas Instruments 
as a sensor for detecting curbs and buggies.  Successful implementation will mean
that RoboBuggy has an obstacle detection system that can be used to help prevent collisions
and improve its safety.
